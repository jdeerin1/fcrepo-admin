== Duke University Libraries Hydra Pilot Project

This code is being developed as part of a Fedora pilot project at Duke University Libraries.

Our intention in the Fedora pilot is demonstrate that Fedora meets the institutional requirements for a preservation repository.  
We have decided to develop the web application layer of the repository with the Hydra framework.
